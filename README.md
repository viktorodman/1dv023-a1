Starting point - http://vhost3.lnu.se:20080/weekend

- The calendar
- The cinema
- The restaurant


## Requirements

- The examiner should be able to run npm run lint in the console to see that there are no errors (or warnings)
- The application should be able to take a parameter with the start URL so one easy could change servers when running the examination.

## Workflow 
- Check which day or days all friends are available; if none - output this on screen
- Get the available movies for that day(s)
- Login to the restaurant web site and get the content
- See when the three friends can eat. Think that they want to book a table minimum two hours after the movie starts.
